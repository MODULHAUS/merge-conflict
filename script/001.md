INT. NIGHT. A CLOSED ROOM, LIT BY A COMPUTER SCREEN.  USING THE GIT TIME MACHINEIS _DAVATAR_.  HE IS HITTING UP AND THEN ENTER ON HIS KEYBOARD, REPEATEDLY.  THE SOUND OF DAMPENED MUSIC FROM THE MAIN ROOM OF THE DEN, OUTSIDE THE DOOR.  

THE DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES QUICKLY AS _JOHNNY_ ENTERS. MUSIC FILLS THE ROOM MOMENTARILY. _DAVATAR_ COMES OUT OF A SLIGHT HAZE AT THE DISRUPTION. 

_DAVATAR_ : Oh, hey, that music sounds amazing, who is that?

_JOHHNY_ : You mean that downsampled drone they've been playing for days?

_DAVATAR_ : Huh, I hadn't noticed...

_JOHHNY_ : Yeah u been zoning, what are u trying to do

_DAVATAR_ : I'm trying to beat you.

_JOHNNY_ : That will never happen.  You would have to hack to much of the past to ever beat me in a race.

_DAVATAR_ : I DID BEAT YOU ONCE!

_JOHNNY_ : No u didn't.

_DAVATAR_ : September 19th, 1996, we raced bikes to the hardware dump.

_JOHNNY_ : You weren't even close!

_DAVATAR_ : And you took that away from me! What's worse is how quickly you were able to hack that.

_JOHNNY_ : The diffs on that commit were quite mimiscule, which speaks to the probability of you ever beating me in a race.

_DAVATAR_ : You're right.  The race doesn't matter to me, because it was such a simple hack.  I could probably redo my victory in 15 minutes.

_JOHNNY_ : Hm!

_DAVATAR_ : I'm going for a much more complex pwn.

_JOHNNY_ : spell that...

_DAVATAR_ : that's right, I'm going to hack the ourcome of a certain chess game

_JOHNNY_ : NO!

_DAVATAR_ : Yes!

_JOHNNY_ : No my equisitely strategic victory over your ass!

_DAVATAR_ : in the only match you defeated me! Applying randomness to a chess game is tricky tho, it would be way easier if I could simply apply logic.  Such a blunder...

_JOHNNY_ : I feel secure for now.  But, D, have you...

_DAVATAR_ : BUT!  I'm getting close. Watch.

_DAVATAR_ PRESSES UP AND ENTER.  CAMERA ON _JOHNNY_ SHRUGGING, STILL WON.  _DAVATAR_ PRESSES UP AND ENTER AGAIN.  

_JOHNNY_ : I still won.

_DAVATAR_ PRESSES UP AND ENTER.  _JOHNNY_ BEGINS DANCING.

_JOHNNY_ : Victorious!

_DAVATAR_ PRESSES UP AND ENTER

_JOHNNY_ : HM? **PAUSE**  Victorious!

// etc etc

_JOHNNY_ : Did you merge commits to any other part of our history?

_DATAVAR_ : No, just this game...

_JOHNNY_ : Yr sure...?

_DATAVAT_ : Of course, Johnny, and even if I had...

_JOHNNY_ : There haven't been any, what do you call them, errors

_DATAVAR_ : conflicts, absolutely not. Not from me.  Johnny...

_JOHNNY_ : What?

_DATAVAR_ : Who did you say is playing that music?

_JOHNNY_ : Distater Radio.

_DATAVAR_ : **slowly** Hm.  Why do I feel like I haven't heard of them before?

_JOHNNY_ : Look, I'm asking cuz a minute ago Johnny left this room, and starting freaking the fuck out like I have never seen.

_DAVATAR_ : And what was the cause, Johnny?

_JOHNNY_ : This Johnny does not know.

_DAVATAR_ : And if not this Johnny, which?

_JOHNNY_ : Which other Johnny could I possibly be referring to?

_DATAVAR_:  Johnny.  Usually, when you speak of Johnny, you are speaking of yourself.

_JOHNNY_ : This is true.

_DATAVAR_ : Then which Johnny is freaking out Johnny, and which Johnny is freaking out me?

_JOHNNY_ : UHG! Go look for youself, and see if you can...!

_DATAVAR_ GETS UP AND SPINS AROUND TO FACE _JOHNNY_, WHO IS WEARING CLOTHES NOT OF TODAY'S OR ANY DAY'S FASHION.  NOTE THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN _DS_ FACE OR FREAK YET. _JOHNNY_ LOOKS BACK AT _D_ NONPLUSSED. THERE IS A PAUSE, THEN _DATAVAR_ BEGIN LAUGHING HISTERICALLY AT _JOHNNY_  

_DATAVAR_ : OHHHHH I SEEEEEEE! OH SHIT! HAHA! I DID NOT PREDICT THAT THE OUTCOME OF A CHESS GAME WOULD TURN YOU INTO A CROSS DRESSER!

_JOHNNY_ LOOKS AT _DATAVAR_ LIKE WTF?? _DTARR_ LAUGHING,

_JOHNNY_ : Will you please jus see what his fucking freak is?

_JOHNNY_ OPENS DOOR OR _DTARR_.  A FAST CRESCENDO A LOUD MUSIC. _JOHNNY_, DRESSED IN OTHER FASHIONS, APPEARS AT THE DOOR AS IT IS OPENED.  A PAUSE.  VIEW OF OTHER _JOHNNY_, WHO SCREAMS SUDDENLY (AGAIN).  CAMERA TO _DTARR_ ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOORWAY.  WE SEE _DTARRS_ FREAK.  OTHER _JOHNNY_ RUNS AWAY AND OUT OF THE HOUSE, REVEALING TO _DTARR_ THE ABSOLUTE WIERDNESS OF EVERYTHING. _DTARR_ SCREAMS.  THE FREAKS ALL RAISE GLASSES AND HANDS AND SPLIFFS AND HOLLAR BACK! THE MUSIC KICKS IN, THE THEME SONG:  MERGE CONFLICT.
