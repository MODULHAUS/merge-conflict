## 000 SYNOPSIS

The story opens on two lifelong friends, hacker mates, bffs.  They are playing with GIT when all of a sudden there are apocolyptic people and music everywhere.  There has been a merge conflict!

Realizing that the current conflict is caused by some merge they make in the future, they have nothing to do but wait it out in the present, conflicted reality.  Which is basically a world where people are freaks and proud,  the world of the "Drop the Bomb" video.

They have no idea how to identify the moment they commit the commit before it happens.  They have to checkout a lot of the past, sans merge, and through these a story is told as too how they came to have and be able to use GIT.  And sometimes they find abstract and impossible branches.

They also soon begin to realize that they are not familiar with the new reality.  Memories begin coming, and they also seem to have quite natural relaions with all of the other wierdos in the den.  They duo also wierded out, of course.  It unfolds that certain members of the freak community are trying to affect the outcome of the merge, in ways that conflict with the Duo's desire to return to the world they knew, and continue their mission...
