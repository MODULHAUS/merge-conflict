## 000 SYNOPSIS

The story opens on two lifelong friends, hacker mates, bffs.  They are playing with GIT when all of a sudden there are apocolyptic people and music everywhere.  There has been a merge conflict!

They discover that the conflict has root in a merge of branches **n** days/months/years ago.  But, there is a mystery.  Neither of them committed that merge!  At least, not yet.

Realizing that the current conflict is caused by some merge they make in the future, they must wait it out in this conflicted reality.  Which is basically a world where people are freaks and proud, the world of the "Drop the Bomb" video.  The Duo are freaks themselves, of course.

They have no idea how to identify the moment when they commit the commit before it happens, all they can do is guard Git and be cautious.  They have to checkout a lot of the past to uncover their true history, which has been merged with the present on.  Through these episodes a story is told as too how they came to have and be able to use GIT.  Their real history is shown, possibly, to be drab, or grim, or sad, or miserable, and that ties into why they are on time machine mission in the first place.  Oh, right!  

And sometimes they find abstract and impossible branches.

But they soon begin to realize that they are not familiar with their __new__ reality, with their new history.  Memories begin coming in, and they have perfectly have relations with all of the other wierdos in the den. But it unfolds that certain members of the freak community are trying to affect the outcome of the same merge, and this conflicts with the Duo's desire to return to the world they knew, and continue their mission.  That is what they want, isn't it?
